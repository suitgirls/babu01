    <h2> Strong Museum</h2>
    <p> 
      The artifact that I had at the strong museum was about the first black women game designer Muriel Tramis! The exhibit Marae and I was about black women in STEM

    My favorite part of the museum was the level up section, when I tried to be stealthy while being in a rush to get back on time.

    <h2>Favorite Robot</h2>
    <p>
      My Favorite robot character from any kind of Media is Lefty from FNAF
      He's my favorite character because of the role he plays in the story and 
      I find it funny how in the game he is worth $5 in the game and can go as low
      as $1. But he has a big play in the lore and story. My character influences about robots  
      to show how robots can be used for the entertainment industry. Nothing changed to much. 
      I can be more careful in thinking about AI/Robots becauase there are many purposes for specific robots.

      <h2> DeScrabble</h2>
      <img src="Descrabble Group Photo.jpg">
      <p> My game is called Descrabble. In order to play it you and another person get an encrpted message.
        To win the game you have to decrypt the message with the provided key and then have to figure out 
        what the scrabbled word was. One problem we encountered was figuring out how to make the game a bit easier
        for people to figure out. We made it so that there was a hint of what the key would look like. Ex. B=I. 
        I wouldnt change our game.

      <p>
        My meme conveys a strong point on how AI Art takes away from artist who went to college and get an art degree only for it to be seen as useless due to ai art and computers doing all the work.
